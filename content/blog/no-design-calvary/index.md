#### CSS vs Design 🆘

Recently, I began working through Josh Comeau's brilliant CSS course - ["CSS for JavaScript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/).

It has unlocked for me things about CSS that I have just barely understood - or have never really understood at all. Going through the lessons slowly has given me an appreciation of how much there is to know about styling things on the web. I knew it was difficult, ofcourse. I have been struggling through CSS since I first began to learn to code four years ago.

**CSS for JavaScript Developers** is jam packed with information. Each module of the course has made clear to me **several things** that I have mentally skimmed over many times - all the while hoping for the best as I skimmed.

I first came across Comeau's work this past summer. Not only is he a very good developer - but he is also a darn good designer - albeit not a full time designer. Somehow he has acquired those skills over time.

And I aspire to that.

The more I learn about CSS - the more closely I look at the visual details of the components I am creating with my code - and the more I separate it from design.

Design and CSS are two different animals. One is reproducing in code, using markup and CSS solutions, some ideas for the visuals of a app and/or website. And the other is coming up with those ideas to begin with.

If either one of those is on shaky ground . . .

The only solution I can think of is the only one that I can implement:

_Do the best that I can and keep growing with it each day._

If I want to continue working on unpaid personal projects ( **which I do** ) then I am looking at **two** marathons in acquiring and growing these skills. Not one marathon.

#### Starving Solo Artistry 🥫 🎨

Over the four year period since I wrote my first line of code - mostly self learning - along with a 12 week bootcamp last year - I have gotten pretty good at HTML, CSS, JavaScript - and the React library - plus it's related frameworks.

I have narrowed my focus to the frontend - and I consider myself far from expert - but I am competent in a general way when it comes to the frontend web development.

Designing my personal projects is very difficult. Unlike working on a team at most companies - when I am working on my own there is no help in site. It's pretty much up to me. Sure, I could ask some friends to help me with design - but not a lot will be learned that way.

I would rather develop my own instincts and intuition. So, I struggle through it.

I am not particularly interested in cloning other apps or websites at this point in my development. Sometimes, I do a limited number of tutorials from effective online educators - but for the most part, I want to implent my own ideas when I spend time coding - for several reasons.

For one thing, any work that I generate at this point in my journey, I want to be able to show potential employers. And I the idea of showiing an Instagram clone does not sound good to me. Ofcourse, it would be a worthwhile learning exercise - but I want something different than that with my limited time.

# No Help Coming 😭

And I am realizing that I just simply have to embrace it and simply do the best that I can. Try as much as I can to develop my tastes and instincts for what works well visually.

I have always considered the web a visual medium - closer to cinema in it's use of various media - than writing on paper - yet pieces of software are tools, right? It is about what the work can _do_.

It is a paradox, it seems.

Beyond being inspired by Comeau's beautiful work - doing more and more of my own work has made me think about these issues for lately.

Beautiful things are mesmerizing. We are attracted to anything that looks good. From other humans, to buildings. It is just the way we are wired as humans.

Software is no exception.

## On my own . . . 😨

There is no money to hire a designer. Even if I wanted to - it would not be practical.

Reminds me of a filmmaker who has no money to hire a cinematographer and so she must learn photograpy, composition, lenses, depth of field, lighting.

And we are not even talking about distribution yet - or anyone seeing the film.

I MUST learn how to make things look good. How else is anyone going to enjoy using my software / web app / or even reading my website?

There is subjectivity involved, and all kinds of intangibles. But that is the nature of the business.

Not only must I have the technical skills to implement my ideas ( CSS coding skills - ie flexbox, positional layout tools, grid, styling solutions like Emotion or CSS Modules, etc ) but I also must have the design skills to come up with something interesting - also.

These are conflicts in the brain. Business logic and deployment skills, churning out ideas for an interesting app, and making it look good - technically and conceptually. I do not subscribe to the left brain / right brain myth. I believe that I can get better at design if I work at it - like anything. But, geez, it is not easy . . .

and finding inspiration from various website from all over the world, the art that you can find on CodePen and other places.

Luckily, there is plenty of help. Josh's course is one source that I have already mentioned. I highly recommend it to any front end developers. I am only about half way through and I have already gotten my money's worth.
