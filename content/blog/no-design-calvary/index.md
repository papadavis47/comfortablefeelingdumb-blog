## CSS and Design 🆘

Recently, I began working through Josh Comeau's brilliant CSS course - ["CSS for JavaScript Developers"](https://css-for-js.dev/).

I am learning things about CSS from the course that I have barely understood in the past - or have never really understood at all.

Going through the lessons slowly has given me an appreciation of how much there is to know about styling content for a browser.

I knew it was difficult, ofcourse. I have been struggling through CSS, with mixed results, since I first began to learn to code four years ago. Not terrible CSS, but not particularly great, either.

**CSS for JavaScript Developers** is jam packed with information. Each module of the course has made clear **several things** that I have mentally skimmed over many times - all the while hoping for the best as I skimmed.

Ofcourse, I am in the process of applying what I am learning to my own work - and that means practice. Now, and in future projects. I still have a long way to go to fully absorb and make my own what Comeau is teaching - but I feel like I am on a better, more solid path now. With much more idea of how the pieces fit together.

I first came across Comeau's [work](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) this past summer. Not only is he a very good developer - but he is also a darn good designer - albeit not a full time designer. Somehow he has acquired those skills over time.

**And I aspire to that.**

The more I learn about CSS - the more closely I look at the visual details of the components I am creating with my code - and the more I separate it from design.

Design and CSS are two different animals. One is producing in code, using markup and CSS solutions, existing ideas for the visuals of an app and/or website.

The other is coming up with those ideas to begin with.

_If either one of those is on shaky ground . . ._

The only solution I can think of is the only one that I **can** implement:

_Do the best that I can and keep growing with it each day._

If I want to continue working on unpaid personal projects ( **which I do** ) then I am looking at **two** marathons in acquiring and growing these skills. Not one marathon.

## Starving Solo Artistry 🥫 🎨

Over the four year period since I wrote my first line of code - mostly self learning - along with a 12 week bootcamp last year - I have gotten pretty good at HTML, CSS, JavaScript - and the React library, plus it's related frameworks.

I have narrowed my focus to the frontend - and while I consider myself far from expert - I have acquired confidence in my skills.

Designing my personal projects is very difficult.

Unlike working on a team at most companies, when I am working on my own there is no help in site. It's pretty much up to me. Sure, I could ask some friends to help me with design - but I would not learn or grow much that way.

I would rather develop my own instincts and intuition. So, I struggle through it.

I am not particularly interested in cloning other apps or websites at this point in my development. Sometimes, I do a limited number of tutorials from effective online educators - but for the most part, I want to implent my own ideas when I spend time coding - for several reasons.

For one thing, any work that I generate at this point in my journey, I want to be able to show potential employers. And I the idea of showiing an Instagram clone does not sound good to me. Ofcourse, it would be a worthwhile learning exercise - but I want something different than that with my limited time.

## No Designers Around 😭

And I am realizing that I just simply have to embrace it and simply do the best that I can. Try as much as I can to develop my tastes and instincts for what works well visually.

I have always considered the web a visual medium - closer to cinema, in it's use of various media, than writing on paper.

Yet pieces of software are tools, right? It is about what the work can _do_.

It is a paradox, it seems.

Beyond being inspired by Comeau's beautiful work - doing more and more of my own work has made me think about these issues for lately.

Beautiful things are mesmerizing. We are attracted to anything that looks good. From other humans, to buildings. It is just the way we are wired as humans.

Software is no exception.

## On my own??? 😨

There is no money to hire a designer. Even if I wanted to - even if that were a good idea for this current point in my journey as a developer - it would not be practical.

Solo devs are like filmmakers who have no resources to hire a cinematographer and so they must learn photograpy, composition, lenses, depth of field, lighting.

And we are not even talking about distribution yet - or anyone seeing the film.

I must learn how to make my work look pleasing to engage with. How else is anyone going to enjoy using my software / web app / or even reading my website?

There is subjectivity involved, and all kinds of intangibles. But that is the nature of designing anything.

Not only must I have the technical skills to implement my ideas ( CSS coding skills - e.g., flexbox, positional layout tools, grid, styling solutions like Emotion or CSS Modules, etc ) but I also must have the design skills to come up with something interesting, also.

These are conflicts in the brain. All kinds of programming logic in building a UI with React, plus things like deployment skills, churning out ideas for an interesting app, and making it look engaging and professional - technically and conceptually.

I do not subscribe to the left brain / right brain myth. I believe that I can get better at design if I work at it - like anything. But, geez, it is not easy . . .

Luckily, there is help if I look around enough. Josh's [course](https://css-for-js.dev/) is one source that I have already mentioned.

There is also the help and inspiration that comes from viewing interesting and beautiful websites and web apps from various companies and individuals around the world. I have also gotten ideas from the art that I have found on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and other places on the web like it.

**It is a process.**

As [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) has written about in a terrific blog [post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/solidifying-what-you-learn) of his:

**Consume, build, teach**.

There are mentors all over the world who I may never meet in person. They have taught me either directly through their educational materials like Josh Comeau and Kent C. Dodds have - or simply through the example of their work such as when I come across a website or app that is particularly beautiful to me.

So, there might not be a design calvary on the way for my personal projects. But help is here. Not on the way. **But already here**. Out on the world wide web.

I only have to look for it to see it ✅
