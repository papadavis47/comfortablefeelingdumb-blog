## A long swim in a vast ocean 🌊 🐚 🦈 🦑

I wrote my first line of code ever in October of 2017. It was while using [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - playing around in a browser based editor with JavaScript - to draw some shapes and fill them with color.

Maybe a month later - at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) I learned some HTML and CSS. Enough to build a small web page. For a challenge - after a guided tutorial - the assignment was to build a single page tribute website tribute - the subject being someone living or dead - famous or unknown.

[This what I built](https://papadavis47.github.io/my_sandbox/) 🤭

Next came learning the basics of programming in Python. I had read somewhere that Python was a good first language for people first learning programming. So, JavaScript and web dev took a backseat for a time - while I struggled with some coding exercises - without context or any real visual feedback outside of the Python REPL in my terminal.

Soon I became frustrated with understanding where code blocks ended and began with Python’s strict spacing syntax - so I switched back to JavaScript and it’s curly brace syntax. Until the frustration wore off and I decided to give Python another chance.

This went on for several months - time which included learning some Bash - as well as Git and GitHub.

I still did not know what kind of programming I wanted to do. The world of programming is huge - and I knew so little. I had an idea that I wanted to learn this craft - in order to make a better living, find work that I could truly grow with and have more professional opportunities that my job at the time. I knew that I enjoyed doing it - difficult as it was. Figuring out what would be my focus - the part of the vastness I would truly master - was like asking: “Which neighborhood in Paris would you like to live in?”

I have never been to Paris. I speak two or three words in French. I do not have any friends living in France. I have **no friggin' clue** about which neighborhood suits me. Still don't.

Programming was like that for me for quite some time. I just kept cruising neighborhoods, talking with people in each one, reading a lot about what I was seeing, checking everything out.

## DRY land 🏖 🙏

I wrote my first lines of React in a coding bootcamp - but I did not fall in love with it until after bootcamp.
Now, I am head over heels in love with it 💕

React is a wonderful library. And the community that has built up around it is brilliant and full of energy.

The world of React is only one island in the Frontend JavaScript archipelago - but for me it is a rich island and one that I intend to explore until I know every inch of it.

The React ecosystem ( including [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), and the incredible number of libraries that have been built around the concept of the React component ) is like finally being able to stand up in the water of a island beach and walk toward the shore.

And this island has beautiful things on it. It has natural resources with which I can build all sorts of wonderful and practical creations with.

And I am far from alone on this island. Far from it. Which is very comforting - especially after having been swimming in a huge ocean for a long time prior to touching sand.

# Some good neighbors

Kent C. Dodds, Cassidy Williams, Josh Comeau, Ali Spittell, Guillermo Rauch, Tanner Linsley, _the D3 guy I will write more about later_ - these are just a few of the accomplished and influential inhabitants of the React island.

_Notes:_
Not understanding the difference between browser code and node code - server side and client side JS.

Also, not understanding the ES6 Modules or Object and Array destructuring - at all

Also, having no clue about async code and promises

These were the challenges with JS
